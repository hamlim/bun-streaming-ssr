# bun-streaming-ssr

This is a simple demo of Bun using [`@srvr-rndr/react`](https://github.com/srvr-rndr/srvr-rndr).

## Getting Started:

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.tsx
```

Then visit localhost:3000!

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.1. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
